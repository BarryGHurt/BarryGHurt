# Good Day

I'm a life long coder with imposter syndrome. 

---

It can be a challenge to keep up with tech, but it's worth the struggle.

## Currently learning - 
   * Rust - worth the effort, but on hold while looking at Go. 
   * Go - currently redoing all the Codility challenges in Go
   * NVidia Jetson NX - GStreamer, camera control, deploying in containers, and of course CUDA

## Projects

It's nice to have a couple of projects that I never have time to work on. Even though there are better implementations out there, I like to do this sort of thing for my own benefit.

   * BirdBot - Camera pointed at bird feeder, identifies and tallys bird species visiting feeder. Unfortunately, the [squirrels](https://youtu.be/U5erMWZwvI0) took over the feeder.
   * Drone Scanner - fly over an area of land, then repeat over time.  I recently got a drone for fun, but realized some parallels with microscopy image management and analyis.
